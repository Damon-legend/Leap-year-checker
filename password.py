#Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the user enters the right password,the program should tell them they are logged in to the system. otherwise, the programshould ask them to re-enter the password. The user should only get five tries to enter thepassword, after which point the program should tell them that they are kicked off of thesystem.

password = int(input("Enter a password: "))
user_password = sambdf5

while password != "user_password" :
    password = int(input("Re-enter a password: "))
if input(password) > 4 :
    print("you are kicked out of the system")
else :
    print("you are logged in !!!")
